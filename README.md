## Features

- **User Authentication via Token:** Secure your platform with user authentication using tokens.
- **List All Files:** Display a comprehensive list of all files available in the system.
- **Upload a New File:** Allow users to upload new files easily.
- **Change Permission of a File:** Grant users the ability to modify file permissions.
- **View a File:** Provide users with the capability to view files directly within the platform.
- **Generate Thumbnails for Images:** Automatically generate thumbnails for image files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Node (version 12.x.x)
- MongoDB
- Redis

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steve2700/alx-files_manager.git
   cd alx-files_manager
  ### Install dependencies:
  1. ```bash
     npm install

  ### Start the application:
```bash
npm start

## Project Structure
The project is organized into various components and functionalities:

-**Authentication**: Token-based authentication for securing user access.
-**MongoDB**: Integration for persistent storage of user data and files.
-**Redis**: Utilized for temporary data storage and caching.
-**Background Processing with Bull**: Asynchronous task handling for operations like thumbnail generation.
**File Operations**: Efficiently managing file-related operations.
Usage
Authentication
The platform utilizes token-based authentication. Users need to obtain a token for accessing protected routes. Include the token in the request headers.

## MongoDB
User and file data are stored in MongoDB. MongoDB models and schemas ensure proper data organization.

## Redis
Temporary data is stored in Redis. Redis serves as a fast and efficient solution for caching and temporary storage.

### Background Processing
Bull is employed for background processing. It manages tasks asynchronously, providing efficiency in operations such as generating thumbnails for images.
